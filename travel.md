</p>

#### Conference Location

The conference will be held on the campus of University of Utah.

The conference will be held at the University of Utah campus in the [Warnock Engineering Building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kpUoc55R6dPmcFLo8). The campus is conveniently located 10 miles from Salt Lake City International Airport and 5 miles from Downtown Salt Lake City. 

#### Accommodations

While group rates have not been organized with any specific hotel, there are many options available near campus and downtown. Good public transportation options exist between downtown and campus making downtown hotels a good option. Parking is also available near the conference venue. The closest two hotels are: 

1. [University Guest House](https://www.universityguesthouse.com/): 10 min. walking  
On campus, suites with two queen beds and one queen sofa bed, full kitchen (3 star, ~$240 per night with taxes)

2. [Salt Lake City Marriott University Park](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/slcup-salt-lake-city-marriott-university-park/overview/): 10 min. driving, 20 min. bus  
On the edge of campus, standard hotel room (3 star, ~$250 per night with taxes)

Many hotels are available downtown. These are often nicer and cheaper but require short travel to campus. One good recommendation is: 

3. [Little America Hotel](https://saltlake.littleamerica.com/): 10 min. driving, 30 min. rail  
Downtown, standard hotel room, very close to light rail stop (4 star, ~$175 per night with taxes) 

#### Travel
